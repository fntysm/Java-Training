encapsulation: when we group of related variables and functions: object
variables: propreties // fields
functions: methods


abstraction;
inheritance: eliminate redandant code
Polymorphism: many forms
a technique to get rid off if else and switch statements
use the same method differently to different objects

Creating an Object in Java: 
className object = new className();

// for Bicycle class
Bicycle sportsBicycle = new Bicycle();
